# Laravel Package Skeleton

This repository is a starter for building Laravel packages. It includes a one-time configuration script, common package resources, development tooling, optional maintenance workflows, and AI guidance for package authors.

## What This Skeleton Provides

- Interactive one-time package configuration with `php ./configure.php`.
- Laravel-native service provider wiring for config, routes, views, translations, migrations, assets, commands, and facades.
- Pest, Larastan, Pint, Testbench, type coverage, and workbench scripts ready for package development.
- Optional maintenance tooling for Dependabot auto-merge, changelog automation, funding, security policy, issue templates, and MkDocs documentation.
- AI guidance and reusable local skills for package authors.

## Getting Started

Use this repository to scaffold a Laravel package:

1. Press the "Use this template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo with the contents of this skeleton, or clone it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laravel/package-skeleton.git my-package
cd my-package
```

2. Run `composer setup` to install dependencies and start the interactive package configuration.
3. Run `composer test` to confirm the toolchain is green.
4. Run `composer build` to rebuild the bundled workbench app under `workbench/`.
5. Run `composer serve` to boot the workbench app at `http://localhost:8000` and test your package end-to-end.

If you prefer to run the steps manually, run `composer install` first and then `php ./configure.php`.

During configuration, `README_PACKAGE.md` is customized and moved to `README.md`, replacing this skeleton README in the generated package.

## Manual GitHub Setup

Some GitHub automation needs repository-level settings after you create your package repository:

1. Enable GitHub Pages and set the source to GitHub Actions so `.github/workflows/docs.yml` can deploy the MkDocs site.
2. Enable auto-merge and allow GitHub Actions to create and merge pull requests so Dependabot minor and patch updates can be merged automatically.
3. Create the labels used by generated release notes if you want clean categories: `breaking`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, `dependencies`, `maintenance`, `skip-changelog`, and `duplicate`.
4. Review branch protection rules for `main`. The changelog workflow needs GitHub Actions to be allowed to commit `CHANGELOG.md` after a release is published.

No additional repository secrets are required; the workflows use GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Previewing Documentation Locally

The documentation scaffold uses MkDocs Material. To preview it locally, install MkDocs Material and run the development server:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
