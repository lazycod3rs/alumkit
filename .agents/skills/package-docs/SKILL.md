# Package Docs

## Primary Goal

Keep package docs concise, accurate, and useful for developers installing, configuring, and contributing to the finished package.

## Workflow

1. Inspect `README.md`, `docs/`, `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`, and contributing docs before writing new documentation.
2. Use the configured package name, vendor slug, namespace, commands, config keys, and publish tags consistently.
3. Remove setup notes that no longer apply to the package.
4. Cover README, VitePress pages, contributing docs, upgrade notes if added later, and package usage examples using Laravel ecosystem tone.
5. Write direct, Laravel-style documentation: short paragraphs, imperative setup steps, concrete examples, and no marketing filler.
6. Keep README content high level and move longer guides to VitePress pages when the details would distract from first-run package setup.

## Writing Rules

- Prefer practical examples over abstract descriptions.
- Use the configured package identity in commands, URLs, badges, namespaces, and publish tags.
- Make installation, configuration, publishing, and usage instructions easy to scan.
- Explain only behavior that exists in the implemented package feature.
- Keep headings stable and predictable so downstream authors can remove or expand sections safely.

## References

- `README.md`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/getting-started/installation.md`
- `docs/getting-started/configuration.md`
- `docs/getting-started/changelog.md`
- `docs/basics/usage.md`
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`

## Examples

- Add installation docs that show `composer require :vendor_slug/:package_slug`, publish tags, and migration steps when relevant.
- Add usage docs with concise examples that show the package inside a normal Laravel application without over-documenting internals.

## Anti-Patterns

- Documenting unreleased or unimplemented package features as if they exist.
- Mixing package names, namespaces, config keys, or publish tags.
- Duplicating large sections between README and VitePress when a short cross-reference is enough.
- Leaking maintenance-only instructions into user-facing package documentation.
